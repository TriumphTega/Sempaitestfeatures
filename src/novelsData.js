      summary: `Seeing the world through your mind is living like no one else.
  
  When one cold summer in the innards of a Tokyo she'd never seen before a wind rose and her hair blew in a magnificent flutter, and magic became a thing, Netty's heart was clenched like an eagle in a pigeon cage. And forever, she's searched for that cold summer's day. Forever…
  
  Until forever fades…
  
  Into chaos!
  
  Every dark alley promises an omen that her grandma would fetishize were she not clutched in the stinging grips of the shallow beyonds—a place Netty knows not of its existence, a place where life continued like the train Legacy.
  
  Her mane is a pride buffering the secrets, padding their leakages, that her soul contains.
  
  To these secrets, Netty is the coin-less beggar on a busy evening whose bowl is yet to be enlightened with what she doesn't know lives within her.
  
  Until a stranger drops a coin… And the wind returns.
  
  The wind returns…
  
  Magic!
  
  Netty!
  
  She pants and runs some more.
  
  Netty!
  
  Netty becomes a traverser where every turn is an electric fence. Still, every turn is a treasure house, and every turn is a school. Netty is a hapless mouse caught in a house. Every turn is the slap of a lemon inside her cheeks. Every turn is the fresh offering of steaming pastry on a winter morning. Winters in Tokyo.
  
  Netty remembers…
  
  When the eyes can't see and the ears go deaf, you will be the speeding man on a busy Tokyo way who cannot see what sits right in front of him—a six-eyed pet panting for some love. The innards of Tokyo are your first steps to freedom. But you must see it—her grandma had poked the center of the maturing globes on her chest long ago—where no one else can.`,

          content: `Legacy has always been revered.

From the outside, you would see a bold inscription painted onto both sides of this mechanical worm, and as it rushed past you, your eyes would zoom left and right as you tried to catch the Legacy inscription on each car. 

I felt light as air, and my feet felt like grass being blown in the wind as the train zoomed past fields. Cows dotted the green carpets with black and white. 

The train zoomed past murky waters and deep blue ones. It scared the fish away. 

Curious critters living on the tracks got squashed, and squelched guacamole textured insides slid onto the unsuspecting pebbles underneath the tracks. 

The train rushed into a hole like a worm going underground. It felt as though I'd been lifted up from my seat close to the window and was about to be thrown to the back of the train. 

“They told me that I would get to see Fish-rabbits,” a dumpy woman scoffed. “Liars. I wish I'd used my ticket money to get food instead.” 

“If anyone finds that cockroach litter they sell at the subway delicious, then it means you have some hope, Netty. Maybe someone would request the recipes for the slop you bring to class.” 

I didn't move. Didn't turn my head away from the window. Didn't even blink or breathe. 

It was easy. Pretending like they didn't exist. It was easy. But not as easy as most people thought. 

“Netty goes deaf sometimes,” a woman in her early 20s says. “It's a quirk of hers.”

“Who knew deafness was a character trait?” 

“People who know Netty,” a blue-haired girl responded and puffed in exasperation. I heard her footsteps receding and I imagined that she'd rolled those brown eyes and shook her head as she catwalked down the aisle. 

The chatter continued. 

It felt like the 600th time the train would circle the atmosphere. Even on an empty stomach, I felt the urge to barf when it circled back down into a tunnel that was deep underground. Darkness cloaked the train. That same darkness choked me. Restricted the air in my lungs so that I took big gulps of air. When the train burst out into the light and it felt as though the darkness was peeled away from my eyes, and from the train. Oxygen snuck back into my lungs.

“I'll have a thousand concussions before I sit next to her!” A pitchy voiced girl's voice pulled me back to the present. “She's not part of the cool girls!”

“Kids,” a man said in a condescending tone and low laughter rumbled through him.

“Kids? They're young adults, Lestor.”

“When you have a couple of teens doing the silliest things that are a reflection of our society right now, you just have to be amused at how they feed the circle of destruction that has become our existence,” he shook his head in amusement. 

“Lestor.” 

“Mary.” 

“How many cups of coffee have you had?” 

When I heard a smack, I imagined the man had hit his forehead with his palm and that he was about to say something like, “Wives,” in an exasperated, playful manner. 

But I heard the smack again and a third time and even though I wanted to keep that the views outside the train fascinated me each time I saw them, I wanted to join the people getting up from their seats and turning around to see the commotion at the back of the train. 

“How horrible,” one of them whispered and another gasped, covering her mouth with her hand.

I looked down at my palms and I rubbed the moisture against my pants. I exhaled, then sucked in air so gently that no one noticed I'd moved. 

A woman was whispering in a harsh, angry tone. 

Someone yelped and there was another smack. 

Another smack. 

The train darkened and something slid into my mind like a ghost passing through a body. It chilled me down to my very bones. 

“Tell me why, Ashley,” he bellowed. The man whose features were lit by the dimness of the candle. “Tell me why.” Smack. Smack. Smack!

“Mom?” My voice was tiny and I was hiding behind the door. “Dad?” 

“Tell me why, Ashley. Tell me!” 

“Dad?” I sobbed. 

He stomped towards the trembling figure that was my mom sitting on the bare floor. 

“David!” 

Light swallowed the train again, and just like that, the memory floated from my mind with the darkness, leaving my fingers cold and trembling. 

“Don't do it anymore!” 

At once, all eyes turned to me, none of them blinking. 

I stood up and my hands were clenched at my side. 

“Why?” Someone asked. “It's Dan's new project.” 

Dan's new project? 

“Dan's new project?” 

“Yes.” 

The woman moved and the crowd parted to reveal two buff action figures I'd never seen before standing face to face on a white, boxy platform like a wrestling ring. They both had angry expressions on their faces.

“He made it.”

“Isn't it cool?” A young boy with low cut hair, Dan, piped. “I can get them to wrestle each other. They look just like miniature humans.” 

“But… Someone hit someone,” I stuttered.  

“Hey! I thought you said she was deaf!” A girl said.

“That was Laz's attack on General Mullen. Their skins are textured just like ours. So naturally their bodies would sound the same way ours would when we're attacked,” a bright smile was on his face all the while. “Check this.” 

He moved the control on the pad in his hands and one of the action figures sent a slap across the chest of the other. Smack! It stumbled and fell on its back. 

“General Mullen is down!” 

The crowd cheered. 

“He got quite the beating, didn't he?” 

“Oh,” was my only response as I sunk back into my seat. 

“Another round of Laz and General Mullen?!” 

The crowd cheered in the affirmative and soon, the noise died down and the smacking continued. No one made a sound as they watched. Some watched with eyes glazed over. Except the woman who'd been harshly whispering before. Whatever her reason for whispering was, it seemed more important that she did it then. 

“Your money's burned and the ride on Legacy ends in 15 minutes,” a man's voice echoed in the speakers and I watched as a shark swirled in a shoal of sardines with its mouth wide open.  

It turned out that Legacies do end, I thought as I stepped down from the train and onto the subway. 

The realization hit me. The Legacy was just an escape route from the normal world. 

I was returning to the bustle that my life was. The noise hit me square in the face. I suddenly remembered that I was a 21 year old college student who'd never had a boyfriend, and more importantly, one who had a thesis to submit the very next day.`,

          content: `Mizuki was sprawled across the floor, her tail flicking left and right and spiraling at the end like she was romancing the chin of a lover. 

I jammed the door shut and she raised her head to look at me. The ray of light that filtered into the room hit her eyes so that her whiskey irises glowed and her pupils expanded in them. 

I turned the key in the lock—jingle-jingle, snap, jingle-jingle, snap—and threw my knapsack to the felt sofa. Then I sat cross-legged on the floor which was strewn with clothes and books. 

Mizuki tilted her head to the side like she was asking, “Where the hell are you coming from?” In less than a second, she was on her feet and was sashaying towards me like a model on the catwalk. Four legs made her more graceful, and her tail which was dancing left and right gave her the illusion of floating. 

“What are you looking at?” I ask when she paused in front of me with one of her front paws in the air and her large eyes peering into my soul. “What?” I pinched my shirt and examined myself, then I looked around where I was seated. “Do you sense something I don't?” 

She purred and gingerly dropped her paw into the cradle between my crossed legs. Then she curled up on me, tail caressing my chin. 

“You sweet thing,” I crooned and smoothed her fur. 

Sitting like this in my apartment with Mizuki's warmth on my legs, I could have drifted to sleep and be pleased then and there. 

But living in the city only confirmed one thing that I've come to learn the hard way, you could never find absolute peace. 

On cue, my cellphone jarred and both Mizuki and I jumped. She scampered away hissing with her hair in spikes and her back curved. 

Yep. That was my fault. I'd changed my ringtone to the discordant noise that naturally issued out of boy bands in the eighties just so I wouldn't miss when it rang. 

I crawled over to the felt sofa, rummaged in the knapsack and pulled out my phone. 

“Court, shouldn't you be asleep?” I asked the moment I picked up. 

“Not when these no-brain brothers of mine are seeing a biking championship on full volume!” She screamed. “Turn that shit down, you bastards!” 

“Hey, she called you a bastard,” a male voice filtered in and male laughter burst through the room even louder than the television. 

“It's not funny! I pay good money at the spa every two weeks so I can look my best! Your stupid habits are messing up my beauty routine! And hold me to my word,—”

“We're gonna regret it,” the male voices chanted in bored timbres. 

“That's right, you—”

“Bastards?” 

“Argh!!” She groaned in frustration and I heard her stomping away, the rumble of their laughter following after her like a swarm of buzzing insects. 

A door slammed. 

“I have news,” her voice echoed as she began and I imagined that she'd raised her fingers up to the light to examine her nails. It was as though she had been speaking about fashion magazines instead of yelling at her brothers just a few seconds ago. “I'll be visiting this weekend with the rest of our study group. We're having an all night study session and you will be our host.” 

“But…” I wondered whether it would be wise to speak up, shook my head and straightened my shoulders to usher in confidence before I said, “We agreed that one time, Court. That we would never use my apartment for our study dates. It's cramped and tiny and you girls are used to more luxury than my home can provide.” 

“And for the millionth time, there's nothing wrong with your apartment. You just don't hide things well is all. It's not that small.” I imagined an eye roll. 

“Hey. Mom and dad are on the phone,” a guy's voice echoed in the room. It sounded like Taylor, a dark-haired, poker faced young man who was always leaning against walls or sitting at his console. 

“It's settled, Netty. Saturday morning. Plus, I need to set these bozos straight.” 

The line went flat. 

I sighed and replaced it into the knapsack. 

“Mizuki,” I called and half of her white fur appeared around a corner with one eye wide open, searching for threats.

I reached into the bag again, picked up the phone and put it on silent. 

“It's gone now.” A tiny smile curved my lips. “Come here. Come here, girl.” 

She jumped onto my bed and curled to sleep. 

I was used to her doing that on some days, so I laughed, sitting there on the floor. 

After an all night study session at Courtney's place, I was ready to be swallowed into an abyss. Too much socializing. It felt as though I would power down anytime soon. 

The night had been spent with study happening only quarter of the time and gossip taking up the rest of it. 

Well, not for me, though. 

I'd been torn between listening in and plugging my ears so I could finish a page of theorem.

My stomach grumbled and I lay spread-eagle on the floor and began to count the ceiling tiles. It was either the hunger forgot its mission and died down, or I got up to count my change or check the dust sitting beautifully in my kitchen cupboards. 

It was an easy choice. 

I rolled over and closed my eyes. 

The world is as vast a place as the sea of your mind. Ever tumbling, ever stirred. Great men are like pirates who learned to tame this sea. They feed their minds with…

Baloney. Eggs. Dumplings. Pizza. The echoing voice of the Vice Chancellor during his speech faded from my mind and was replaced with my hungry thoughts. 

I saw eggs floating under the bright blue hue of underwater, dancing with a pair of sausages. A slice of bread strutted by them and they paused to watch as the bread walked away and went deeper into the sea. It wasn't in the least bit soggy. 

Immediately, the eggs and sausages looked at themselves then at the bread. 

The eggs cracked open and were cooked into sunny side perfection, and the sausages were browned all around. 

Harmonized in an unspoken alliance, they chased after the bread and my mouth watered, hoping for when they would catch the lone slice. They smelled so good.

Suddenly, several slices started raining down into the sea and someone said,

“Now that's a perfect breakfast if ever I saw one.” 

Something smacked my cheek and I opened my eyes. 

“Geez louis. That baloney's perfect. Imma throw it back in the pan and—”

“Baloney?” 

I sat up and there was a woman in my apartment with wild brown hair and a sassy smile on her chocolate face.`,

            content: `I've always been fascinated with the rain. How it sounded when it hit my roof at the top of the apartment building. How it sounded when it hit the floor or windows or any piece of metal especially. 

I loved the cold smell of rain. Loved how calming each drop of cold water was on the skin. I loved how the rain could silence the thoughts in my head and bring back memories that never truly left, for I yearned to go back to such times when the world was a beautiful place and life was simple. 

If wishes were horses was the saying, right? But even now when the world relied on more and more machines for their needs, horses were scarce and expensive to acquire. Such a lose-lose situation. 

I could see the world from where I was high on my apartment's balcony, and the world was empty. Only a few people were out on the road and some were tucked into street corners. 

Cars splashed water into these corners as they zoomed past with headlights on full power, and the people retreated into these corners a bit more. Their heads were buried in their clothes with the collars pulled high. Their lips, I guessed, were pursed in that silence of the broken. If tears ran down their faces, then I hoped it warmed their cheeks even if it was just for a second before the cool evening air froze it. 

Rain poured on my face and several dropped from the roof of the balcony. A few large drops sank into my head and spread across the strands of my hair. It tickled, I giggled. Another car passed, I sighed.

“You sure you're good out here, sweetie? Now, I don't want you catching a cold.” The wild brown hair woman draped a towel over my shoulders and patted my hair. “You tell me whatever it is you need, okay, cupcake?” 

I nodded. 

She went back inside. 

When I'd woken up from my dream that morning and I'd seen her cooking in my kitchen with ingredients that were surely not mine, seeing as my kitchen was empty of food, I'd immediately asked her where she'd gotten the ingredients. And what she wanted. 

“Nothing more but to take care of you, sugar,” she'd answered and patted my head then slid several plates of food on the kitchen table. 

I hadn't hesitated to dig in. 

In hindsight, it was pretty foolish to trust someone like that but hey, my tummy was full and I wasn't dying yet. 

Neither was Mizuki who'd eaten a whole can of tuna. 

The sky was gloomy and it was afternoon but most people were at their jobs and I had no classes that day. The only thing on my mind was an expensive craving for chocolate ice cream. 

I bet I had some change in my purse. Enough to buy ice cream. But I sighed. That was money I could use to stop at the grocery store to get the things I needed. Things essential for my survival so I wouldn't starve to death once the ice cream was gone. 

I heard the woman singing in my tiny kitchen. I hadn't even asked her name. But I pushed away from the railing I was leaning against and I took the towel off my shoulders. 

“I want to go out to the ice cream store,” I said when I got to the kitchen.

“It's a cold day for ice cream, but I've never been known to deny cravings, cupcake. Ooh, and you've got funds.” She laughed and headed straight to a bright pink handbag sitting in the corner. 

Funds? 

If she meant she wanted to give me money for the ice cream, then I would probably hug Mizuki when I told her thank you. It was best to avoid hugging strangers even if I wanted to. 

But you would eat a stranger's food and take a stranger's money? Yeah, good morals. 

“Don't worry,” I stammered. “I have money for ice cream.” 

“You think I was gonna give you my money?” She laughed. “Be for real, baby girl. I'm giving you your own cash. You gotta put it to good use out there.” She handed me a pink credit card with a bright yellow sun pasted on it. “Don't worry, they'll accept it anywhere you take it to. Even the bank. Pin is 9788. Enjoy yourself.” 

I stood there with the card in my hand. 

I turned it to the back and it was pretty much just a card. There were none of the normal things you would see in a normal credit card on it. No chip or card number or even a bank name. 

“Are you…” I began but I heard her singing in my room and guessed she'd decided to arrange my things. 

I should be freaking out that a stranger was in my home with me, but instead I was more concerned with whether to go to the ice cream store with the card or just chuck the useless piece of plastic into the bottom of my bag and forget its existence.

Childish as it was, my lower lip trembled that I wouldn't be getting any ice cream. The people at the store would look at me like I'd gone crazy if I handed this to them. So I sighed and hid the card among a few books, grabbed the towel and returned to the balcony to cry in the rain as the day passed me by while I wallowed in my own misery. 

Worse off were those sitting in the corners of the street, but it didn't make the fact that I was broke any less painful.

***

Evening arrived with gloom. And even though the sky was still a rumbling mass of dark clouds pouring down water, the streets were filled with people who hurried to go places—most likely their homes. 

My craving for ice cream had only grown. But I wasn't sad about it this time. I stood from the balcony thoroughly soaked to the skin. 

I took my dripping self to my room and peeled off the clothes from my body. I stepped into the shower and simply washed off the residue of rain water on my skin. I dried myself when I was out, got a pair of pants, a hoodie and an umbrella. 

I took the card out from between the pages of the book and gathered the change I had into my pockets. 

The woman was sitting on the living room floor and Mizuki was rubbing against her arm and purring. 

“I'm heading out,” I said to her. 

As I watched her play with Mizuki, my heart swelled with affection that the two had formed a bond so briefly after meeting. There was no fear whatsoever in my heart that she would kidnap my cat or anything of the sort. 

Without looking up, she said, “Have fun, cupcake.” 

And I nodded before closing the door behind me. 

The only time I intended to have fun was when I had ice cream in my hand. I would get it somehow.`,

Pulling out the pink piece of plastic from the tight-knit chaos that was happening in my bag. I raised it to the glaring lights lining the glass windows of the shop for an inscription. I find none.</p> <p>I couldn't go in there with this piece of plastic to buy anything without coming out embarrassed when the card didn't work.</p> <p>I mean, who even used a pink credit that didn't have a known bank name or anything of the sort.

She could use some water to rinse off the skirt before drying it, I thought. I didn't stain her skirt with anything permanent. But then I hadn't apologized because I'd seen her walking with a camera, clearly making a vlog in the rain.</p> <p>My apparent poverty was enough punishment. I didn't need to be seen on a random stranger's blog with a red nose while I'd been pitying myself before kicking that puddle. I didn't need the internet, and generally my schoolmates, to point fingers at me or walk up to me and say, “Hey, Netty. Did you really ruin that lady's 600-dollar skirt and all you said was ‘sorry’? The least you could have done was get her a new skirt.”</p> <p>That's right. The word would be ruined. But no one would mention that the puddle contained only sand and water, two very harmless elements when it came to clothes.</p> <p>“Join the queue, Miss.”</p> <p>He had such huge, dark brows sitting on his young, weak-chinned face. In his doorman uniform, you could easily mistake him as some spoilt gentleman from a bastardly rich home who'd materialized out of a British novel as the man seeking the hands of a shy bride.</p> <p>“It's right over there, Miss.”</p> <p>I looked in the direction he was indicating.</p> <p>“I'll just stay here,” I whispered to myself and stood close to a wall of ice cream graffiti, pretending to be taking pictures of the murals. He offered me a small smile as if he understood. I glanced at him and glanced away, saying nothing.</p> <p>Here I was in this shop with a useless piece of plastic in my bag, and I was still unsure if I should leave without buying anything or walk towards the counter and embarrass myself.</p> <p>I would wait for a few minutes before I walked out, I thought to myself, but half an hour later, I was no longer taking pictures. Instead, I was watching as the line thinned down to only three people—a small girl in tights soiled at the bottom by rainwater and a blue tutu with sparkles, and her parents.</p> <p>Her father lifted her and she gently pointed at the bubblegum-flavored ice cream.</p> <p>“It's blue like my tutu, daddy.” She looked at his face expectantly and hugged his neck with her tiny arms.</p> <p>We'll have that flavor, please. With vanilla and chocolate.”</p> <p>“Impressive, aren't they?” A man said. His phone, back camera targeted at the wall, made excessive shutter sounds while he changed angles with the speed of light. “One would think it unnecessary to use graffiti for an ice cream shop. I mean, why not plaster cute stickers all over for the kids and some gangster-looking ones for teenagers? But no. Graffiti. Genius. What's your name again?”</p> <p>I looked around me to be certain he was speaking to me. No one was standing close to us so it had to be me, but I started scrolling through tweets on my phone without even reading them.</p> <p>“You didn't tell me your name. I should take a picture of you.” Snap! “Perfect. You'd look good on an ugly wall. Best way to brighten up something that's already damaged.”</p> <p>“You can't take my pictures without my consent.” My shyness evaporated. I felt blood pounding through my veins. “Delete it.” My tone was hard as anger burned in my heart.</p> <p>He straightened up with a hurt look on his round face. Then he pouted and held his phone down with both hands like a child being scolded. “Be nice,” he said. I nearly threw up with the tone he used.</p> <p>“Delete my picture.”</p> <p>“Be nice, young lady.”</p> <p>His tone changed, and he spoke to me like he would to a misbehaving dog he was trying to correct.</p> <p>Confusion sets in then. The confusion changed to fear.</p> <p>What did he mean by I should ‘be nice’?</p> <p>I walked away from him and headed to the counter. He watched me with that pout on his face and I felt so close to retching. If I didn't vomit, I'd probably smack his face with one of the ice cream trays if he got any closer to me. Anything to stop him from treating me like I was a bad, wicked pet.</p> <p>“Your order?”</p> <p>“Two scoops of chocolate, one scoop of vanilla, and one scoop of bubblegum,” I said the order I'd had in my head all day with my eyes on my soaked sandals and my voice very low.</p> <p>The couple and their daughter were gone.</p> <p>The loud smack of the covered plastic ice cream bowl hit the counter and I remembered that I had no money.</p> <p>Shutter. Shutter. Shutter.</p> <p>My heart jumped.</p> <p>I looked to the left and saw the man with his phone held up, the pout still on his face. The staff was oblivious as their loud voices were raised high in jokes from the back.</p> <p>“Do you accept credit cards?” I asked in a shaky voice.</p> <p>We do.”</p> <p>I handed over the card the woman had given me.</p> <p>She gasped before swiping it through the machine. Then she handed it back to me with my ice cream secured in a plastic bag.</p> <p>Shutter. Snap.</p> <p>Learn to be nice, young lady! Or I'd be very disappointed!”</p> <p>The man shouted from inside the store as I rushed past the doorman with tears already riding down my cheeks.</p> <p>My shoes squelched with the quick rhythm of my walk.</p> <p>I paused on the almost empty street.</p> <With a shout of frustration, I smashed the ice cream on the sidewalk. Picked it up and smashed it again.</p> <p>Alarmed people formed a line that went directly around me like I was some dangerous animal.</p> <p>I fell to my knees and sobbed.</p> <p>How could someone I didn't even know make me feel so much less than human?</p>`,

Unlike me.</p> <p>“You have to accept that she isn't like other children,” my grandma had said to my mother one rainy day when I'd lain on the grass to watch how every drop hit the ground while other children played. It had splashed on my face and when I came back up, my head was a mess of sand, bits of grass and water, and all the children ran from me screaming that I was the monster trying to get them.</p> <p>A normal child would have chased them around as they expected me to, but I'd seen a toad hop past, and I'd tried to catch it just to place it on my head because I thought the sand and grass on my head would be a suitable habitat for the hopping little creature.</p> <p>“A descendant of mine who is definitely more like I am,” Grandma had said that night while I'd sat at the table with my cousins and the rest of the family, picking out the greens from my soup to slurp on them. Her face glowed with pride.</p> <p>Being in the more remote parts of Tokyo like this on a rainy night made me feel as though I could finally breathe and I could finally take in the whole scenery.</p> <p>I could see far ahead of me. The streets were beginning to empty as people filtered into their homes, shops and even into street corners. The high buildings—just like the one her apartment was in—and the strip of two-way roads, an interlocked sidewalk and the semi-darkness that was the natural collaboration of the dark, cloudy sky and the dimly glowing lamps lining the road. Puddles sat in slight depressions while water flowed through the covers of sewers in a satisfying rush.</p> <p>I felt so small, but still so powerful as the street emptied. A sojourner in a world I rarely experienced. A quiet downtown Tokyo had to be another world.</p> <p>My hands were tucked inside my coat while I walked with my knapsack hanging from my shoulder.</p> <p>I should have gotten more ice cream. Shouldn't have smashed the one I had. Mere minutes ago, I was against the idea of getting any more ice cream. But now, I craved chocolate again. The credit card was still in my bag. I could decide to turn around and return to the shop to buy myself some more ice cream, but I kept walking ahead. There was no use for it now, was there? And what if the credit card didn't work?</p> <p>The peaceful shower intensified and the sheets of slanted rain pouring like seeds from the sky was simply a work of art against the extra street lights turned on.</p> <p>I paused and looked around myself, drawing a deep breath into my lungs.</p> <p>“I love the smell of rain,” I said to the empty streets and continued walking.</p> <p>I felt a strange peace. Now, the creepy man taking my pictures didn't existence anymore. I was content except for one thing.</p> <p>Ice cream.</p> <p>I was torn between continuing my journey to nowhere in particular and going back to get more ice cream before heading back to my apartment.</p> <p>I missed the sound of Mizuki's purr.</p> <p>The rain stopped.</p> <p>It was as though someone turned off the rain the way they would a faucet.</p> <p>I paused and stretched my palm out for stray drops from the sky. I got nothing.</p> <p>“What are you doing here?”</p> <p>Like a switch was flipped, the rain poured harder from the sky, bearing down on me so fiercely that I began to feel it soak past the coat I had on.</p> <p>A whoosh of wind. The crack of a whip.</p> <p>I jumped and looked around.</p> <p>“It's too late to be scared,” the warm voice echoed from the space between two buildings.</p> <p>Followed by the silhouette of a lithe looking young woman were echoes of her footsteps from alleys down the road.</p> <p>I gasped and took a few steps back when she came under the faint night light.</p> <p>“I don't plan to take pictures of you,” she said in an amused voice. “But I see you've used the card.”</p> <p>I didn't respond. If she knew about the card, then she must have been watching me. I hadn't even had an inkling that eyes had been on me.</p> <p>“Where are you going?" Your apartment's that way,” she pointed one sharp nail in the opposite direction with a drawl in her voice.</p> <p>“I—”</p> <p>“Yes, taking a walk. I can see that.” She stretched her hand out in the large space between us. “Let me see it.”</p> <p>“See what?”</p> <p>“The card, you retard.”</p> <p>Everyone seemed convinced that I was some sort of idiot. The creepy man who took my pictures. Now she.</p> <p>Maybe I was. Because I was walking towards her with the card in my hand, closing the space between us and placing the card in her hand.</p> <p>She smirked.</p> <p>A flash of light traveled through the card and she held it between her forefinger and middle finger.</p> <p>“Come on,” she gestured to me to take the card from her.</p> <p>I pinched the card and she released it. It was like the exchange between a scared child, buying something fascinating for the first time, and a cocky adult.</p> <p>“That was too easy.”</p> <p>She laughed and suddenly, she was gone. Just disappeared.</p> <p>I realized that the rain has never stopped falling, but the drops had stilled, accumulating in the air like frozen bubbles.</p> <p>The moment she left, everything fell, bathing me and splashing on the road. The pour continued.</p> <p>All I could think of was going to the mall with the card in hand. I had so many things to buy.</p>`,

            content: `<p>Mizuki's loud meow should have sounded like a <i>welcome home</i>, but it sounded instead like she was judging me. With the unblinking wide-eyed stare she gave me and how she sat high on the back of the felt sofa, it was as though I was a stranger that was breaking in.</p> <p>She was so used to my spending habits that even I would have thought the same if I were her because—</p> <p>“Goodness gracious!” The dark lady said when she came around the corner. One hand was over her chest and she looked at me with wide eyes. “Did you buy the whole mall, girl?”</p> <p>“Help...” I grunted, “Me.”</p> <p>I crumpled to the floor. The shopping bags lined on my arms dropped like canons.</p> <p>The dark lady was still standing, watching me with wide eyes, and Mizuki was not relenting in her judgment.</p> <p>I pulled my arm through the handles of the bags and sighed in relief. I felt so lightweight. And I couldn't feel my arms.</p> <p>“What?” My cheeks flushed. It seemed as though in the short time I'd been gone, Mizuki and this woman had formed an alliance. <em>Betrayal!</em> I should think, but somehow it felt right that Mizuki bonded with her. “I got everything we need,” I said, getting to my feet and looking directly at Mizuki. I wished she would stop looking at me like that.</p> <p>She meowed, stood on all fours, and tentatively walked the length of the back of the sofa. Then she turned around and jumped off, disappearing round the door that led to my bedroom. The last I see of her is the fluffy tail I'd tied a little pink ribbon in the shape of a bow when she was asleep. If she'd been awake, she would never have let me.</p> <p>I stared at the door hoping she would slink back around it. I'd forgotten about the dark lady until I heard a rustle and saw her squatting close to a bag of the things I'd bought.</p> <p>“I can't lie, this is surprising.”</p> <p>I opened my mouth, ready to defend myself because I knew what this made me look like. From a poor girl wondering how to pay the next college due and feeding herself and a demanding cat to that girl who stumbled upon a gold mine she was determined to drain.</p> <p>“But I'm impressed you took the initiative. It's your card, after all.”</p> <p>“My card?”</p> <p>“Well, yes, girl. You think my credit card can afford all this? I estimate it's not up to five hundred dollars, but it's still too much for me to spend in a day. My phone would have buzzed itself till I had a flat battery.”</p> <p>“Well...” I said, somewhat relieved that she wasn't offended. It'd be the last time I spent like this again, however. Where that sudden need to splurge had come from was a mystery but— “Did you say this card belongs to me?”</p> <p> <i>Meow.</i> </p> <p>Mizuki walked around the corner before the lady could answer. She slinked towards me and rubbed her body against my calves as though to tell me, “You're forgiven.”</p> <p>Then she looked at me with sharp eyes as though to say, “Don't ever do that again!”</p> <p> <i>Meow.</i> </p> <p>She walked over to one of the bags and, with caution, began to inspect its innards, using her front paw to push the bag further open before walking into it to sniff the contents.</p> <p>“Yes. The card is yours.”</p> <p>“Where did you get such a card from? Why would you give me such a card?”</p> <p>“There are questions I can't answer, girl. The whys and wheres and hows. I can't answer them.” She stood to her full height, her afro seemed to become even more prominent as she stood a few inches over me even though it seemed as though she was towering over me. A Goliath where I was simply a shepherd boy. “And besides, I delivered what I was told to. You got what you need. I wasn't meant to stay more than a day.”</p> <p>“What are you talking about?”</p> <p>“Mizuki's really lovely, Netty dear. She'd like it if you played with her more.” Then she got closer to me and touched my shoulders. “When anything threatens to go wrong, trust your instincts. That's something my dad always said.”</p> <p>My instincts said I should stop delaying getting acquainted with this stranger whom I'd trusted without her even having to prove herself. Her presence in the house was as though a loved aunt had come to visit when life was falling apart—I was comforted by it, but I still did my own thing.</p> <p>She walked into the room and came out with a green handbag. “I hope I'm not forgetting anything.” She looked around.</p> <p>“You're leaving?”</p> <p>“Well, yeah. I can't stay here forever.”</p> <p>“But—”</p> <p>“Don't worry, dear. Everyone likes me for a reason. That same reason is why you also like me.”</p> <p>“What's that?”</p> <p>“She laughed. “Mizuki found your bag of chips.”</p> <p>I looked at the cat swinging with a yellow bag of Lays chips, swinging it left and right before pausing, dropping it, and staring at it. She lost interest and snuck back into the bag.</p> <p>There was a warm smile on my face.</p> <p>“What's your name?”</p> <p>I turned back and I didn't see the woman anymore.</p> <p>Perplexed, I went into my bedroom, the balcony, and even the kitchen area to search. But I saw no one.</p> <p>“Are you in here?” I asked, coming back into the living room.</p> <p> <i>Meow.</i> </p> <p>Mizuki answered me, waving her tail in the air.</p> <p>“She's gone.”</p> <p> <i>Meow.</i> </p> <p>Mizuki rubbed herself against my calves, looking up at me patiently and waving her tail.</p> <p>I rummaged in one of the bags, got out a can of tuna from the millions in there, opened it, and took out a clean dish from the kitchen area. I poured the fish on the plate and set it down on the floor.</p> <p>Mizuki attacked without a second's hesitation.</p> <p>Suddenly, the house felt so empty.</p> <p>How could one person fill a home with so much... homeliness?</p> <p>And why didn't I know her name?</p> <p>I looked at my bag sitting with the pile of shopping and grocery bags on the floor and wondered where she'd gotten the card she'd given me.</p> <p>I wanted sausages and eggs. The kind she made for me when I woke up from my hungry dream.</p> <p>I felt weak.</p> <p>It felt like a loss that she was gone.</p> <p>I squatted beside Mizuki and stroked her fur, that feeling of loss and the sudden quiet of my apartment sitting heavy within me.</p> <p>“At least, Mizuki, we'll eat well tonight.”</p> <p>And I got up and locked the front door.</p> <p>I wanted to go to bed.</p>`,

            content: `I woke up with a gentle feeling of loss. 


Still sitting on my bed with the covers pooled at my waist and Mizuki sleeping soundly right beside me, I could feel a deep sinking feeling. 


It felt like the one time I'd almost drowned when I'd gone swimming alone while my parents fought on the beach. I'd seen the sky beneath the surface of the water, and I'd smiled at it. Bubbles had floated right past my eyes to the surface of the water. Those bubbles had been the oxygen I'd stored in my mouth before diving. 


I'd taken big gulps of water out of panic. And it'd felt like each gulp had settled heavy in my stomach, pulling me down to the very bottom. Gravity hadn't seemed to exist anymore. The heavy feeling became a thing of hope. I'd thought then that maybe I'd finally be in a world where my parents didn't scare me anymore and didn't argue about the smallest things. But what if I never saw them again. 


That bittersweet feeling, being torn between a desire and a worry. Not truly knowing how I was meant to feel but feeling melancholic yet happy. 


That was how I felt sitting on my bed that cold morning. 


I reached out and stroked Mizuki's fur. Her ears twitched and she wiggled a bit. 


“Good morning,” I whispered, and my room responded with silence. No echoes, just comfortable, padded silence. 


I heave a breath. A wind blows in through the window. 


It was still early in the morning with the sky still wearing the blanket of that early morning blue. 


I burrowed underneath the covers and closed my eyes. Warmth enveloped me, and I drifted into sleep. 


I didn't have to worry about not having anything in my kitchen or wondering how to keep my cat well fed and pay a million bills at college. 


If it could last forever…


I didn't let myself think of it. I accepted the warmth and the silence and the peace that came with sleep. I let it overwhelm me. 


Here was an infinitely perfect moment, and I wanted to hold it forever before I get drawn deep into…`,
